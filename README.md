    <summary> Introduction to Simulator </summary>
A simulator is a piece of software that allows you to test the functionality of a circuit design before it is implemented in hardware. This is done by mimicking the design's behavior in software using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL. The Register Transfer Level (RTL) design is the Verilog code that implements the circuit, which is the 
behavioral representation of the specification in an HDL language. To ensure that the RTL design adheres to the specifications, a testbench is built in HDL and simulated with the open-source
simulator, Icarus Verilog. The testbench generates stimulus signals that are applied to the RTL design, and the simulator verifies that the output signals are valid. Changes in the 
    input signals are monitored by the simulator. The simulator re-evaluates the RTL design and updates the output signals when an input signal changes. The simulator saves changes to the input 
    and output signals in aÂ Value Change Dump (VCD) file. This file is used to display the design's behavior over time in the form of waveforms. To open the VCD file and examine the design, a 
    tool called GTKWave is needed, which aids in debugging the design and checking its operation in compliance with the specification.
